Program starts with: Algorithm Nameoftheprogram;
Then goes variable and const declaration: 
Const Nameofvariable = value; for constant variables
Var Nameofvariable:Typeofvariable(entier(integer),reel(float),bolean(bool),texte(string),charactere(char)); for variables.
note that we can declare many constants by separating them with a ";" and many variables separating them with a ","
Then we move to the instructions:
We start we a: Debut
then we have the following instructions for now:
lire(variablename); it's the equivalent of readln in pascal
ecrire("msg" or variable name or as many paramaters); the equivalent of writeln in pascal
Assignements are made like in the pascal language following the same syntax and same rules, for example Variable := 8; or Variable := a + b; and so on.
We end our algorithm with: Fin
